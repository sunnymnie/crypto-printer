Based on this null hypothesis probability distribution, we compute the probability p that the t-statistic will be at least as extreme (allowing for the possibility of a negative test statistic). This probability p is called the **p-value**, and if it is very small (let’s say smaller than 0.01), that means we can “reject the null hypothesis,” and conclude that the backtested average daily return is statistically significant."
